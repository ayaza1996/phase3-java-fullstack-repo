Phase 3:
=============================
Developing and Deploying Java-based Backend application
  - Develop Web applications with Spring and Spring Boot
  - DevOps Practice (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)
  - Testing the application
  - Ecommerce applications - Web Applications (Model-View-Controller) for browser (pages)
    - Integration layer with Web services

=============================================================================
    Web application <---------> DB (SQL - RDBMS (MYSQL, Postgresql..) , NoSQL - MongoDB, DynamodB, Neo4j)

* In our course, we will be connecting web application to RDBMS.
    Web application <---------> SQL RDBMS (MYSQL)
=============================================================================

* Difference between Microservices and DEvOps?

    Software are also evolving on technologies and architecture
    Microservice is an architecture used for developing the applications.
    DevOps -----> Practices, 
                   Collabaration of teams (developer - develop & test the code 
                                          deployed - put on the production server )
                  + set of tools 

        - Develop and deliver software to market faster
   ========================================================================

        Full stack developer
                - Frontend  (UI) + BAckend (Java / .NET/ ) + DB + Devops
        Mean stack
         Mongodb+express framework+Angular(UI)+NODEJS (Backend) + Devops

Agenda of Day 1
============================================================
 - Various software development model
- What is DevOps
- Maven 
- Spring Core - Practice (spring setup) + Spring core container + Wiring

Current approach for Java project that you have followed:
- currently - Java project + downloaded jar files and add them in build path


To understand DevOps need 
===========================================

  *  what was followed for software developmenet earlier?
SDLC was managed in
      - WATERFALL MODEL

        a. Organizations used to work with Waterfall software developemnt methodlogy.
      - It was first document life cycle model in 1970 by Royce
      - Developmenyt method followed - LINEAR and SEQUENTIAL
      - Each development phase has distinct goals
      - Think of "Change of Requirements" not easy to deal 


We needed continuous feedback on the product.

 * Solution Approach used today  - AGILE Methodology
Advantages:
=========================
Feature by Feature - development
Ecommerce
   product feature
      - user stories
   Order feature
    - user stories    
- More customer centric, as customer is involved in all iterations.


We also need agile priciple, + collabration between DEVELOPMENT Team & OPERATION Team


What is Dev + ops (Containers, machine - infrastructure)

DEVELOPER
QUALITY ENgineer
Operation Team

DevOps
    - the culture
    - collabarate in team Dev-tester  , DEV-TESTer-Operation


DevOPS workflows 
  - Continuous Integration  (CI) - auotmate 
  - Continuous Delivery (CD) - automate 
   - mailer .. feature is ready for production? 
  - Continuous Deployment (CD) - may be manual or automate based on project

To automate the workflows Devops tools can be used.

DEVOPS STAGES
================================================
01 - Version Control - MEans do source code management - Maintain different versions of the Code

02 - Continuous Integration - Means do continuous build - Compile, validate, core review, Unit testing, Integration testing

03 - Continuous Delivery - Means do continuous testing - Deploying the build application to test servers, performing UAT

04 - Continuous Deployment - Means do Configuration MAnagement & contanerization - Deploying the tested application on the PROD server for release

========05 - Continuous Monitoring===============
